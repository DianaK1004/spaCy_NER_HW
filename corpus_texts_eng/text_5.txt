Former Georgian Prime Minister and opposition party leader Giorgia Gakharia has been treated in hospital after he came under attack at a hotel, reportedly by members of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Gakharia is said to have suffered a broken nose in the incident in Batumi on the Black Sea coast. His party said it was "politically motivated" and aimed at intimidating the opposition. The southern Caucasus state has seen political turmoil and repeated attacks on opposition figures and protesters in the months since Georgia's contested elections in late October. Protests have taken place every night since Georgian Dream's leaders announced a month later they were freezing the issue of opening talks on joining the European Union.
