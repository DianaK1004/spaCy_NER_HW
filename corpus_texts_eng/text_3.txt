South Korea's president Yook Suk Yeol has been arrested by anti-corruption investigators, following a weeks-long stand-off between investigators and his personal security detail.The 64-year-old, who plunged South Korea into political turmoil with his short-lived martial law declaration on 3 December, is the first sitting president to be arrested. Yoon's attempt at martial law led to his impeachment by parliament on 14 December, though a constitutional court still has to decide if his impeachment is final. The Central Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), also began investigating Yoon for insurrection -which is punishable by life in prison or death. But Yoon refused to cooperate with the authorities, ignoring several summonses to come in for questioning. This led to the CIO applying for an arrest warrant to bring him in. His arrest on 15 January came after a failed attempt 12 days before, which saw his supporters and the Presidential Security Service (PSS) block authorities from reaching him at his official residence in Seoul.
